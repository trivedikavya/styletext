# 🔡 LinkedIn Text Formatter – UI Redesign

## 🛠️ What I Did
I redesigned a web tool that allows users to format LinkedIn text with styles like **bold**, *italic*, and more using Unicode characters.

The original inspiration came from a website called **Style Text**, which offered free resources for LinkedIn formatting—but had a poor user experience. I took the core idea and rebuilt it with a focus on simplicity and usability.

## ❌ Problems with the Original Site
- ❌ Confusing UI
- ❌ Difficult to navigate
- ❌ Complicated text selection and copying
- ❌ Poor overall usability for a simple task

## ✅ What I Improved
- ✅ Clean and user-friendly interface
- ✅ Added a **"Get Started"** button to guide users
- ✅ **Selective text styling** – instead of converting the whole input to one style, users can now apply bold, italic, or other styles **to specific words or parts of the text**
- ✅ Simplified text copying process
- ✅ Ensured styled text appears exactly the same on LinkedIn
- ✅ Improved overall performance and functionality

## 🎯 Main Goal / Purpose
Originally, I built this for myself to solve a real frustration when formatting LinkedIn posts.

Eventually, I decided to **broaden the purpose** by:
- Enhancing the free resources available on similar sites
- Making the platform more accessible to others
- Creating a tool that’s easier to use for everyone
